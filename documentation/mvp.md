For the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Peacecraft, we should focus on the core mechanics while keeping development as lean as possible. Here’s how we can define it:
Peacecraft MVP Plan
Core Features for MVP

    Basic Conflict Resolution System
        One simple scenario (e.g., someone cuts in line).
        Player types their own responses.
        AI interprets responses and reacts dynamically.
        Simple win/loss condition: Player wins if conflict de-escalates, loses if it escalates.

    AI-Driven NPC (Single Personality)
        One AI opponent personality (e.g., The Aggressor).
        AI tracks trust level and adjusts responses accordingly.
        Basic tone analysis (e.g., detects aggression, neutrality, or empathy).

    Simple Frontend (React)
        Text-based chat UI where players interact with the NPC.
        Input field for player responses.
        Dialogue box displaying AI responses.
        Basic progress tracking (e.g., trust bar, status updates).

    Backend (FastAPI + AI Integration)
        FastAPI backend to handle game logic.
        Ollama AI integration for NPC responses.
        Basic database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL) to track game state.

    Basic Game Flow
        Start game → Engage in conflict → AI reacts → Player responds → Win/Loss condition.

MVP Development Phases
Phase 1: Backend Setup

✅ Set up FastAPI backend.
✅ Connect Ollama AI to generate NPC responses.
✅ Implement basic AI conflict logic (simple scenario + personality).
Phase 2: Frontend Prototype

✅ Create simple chat UI (React).
✅ Implement player input system.
✅ Display AI responses in a conversation format.
Phase 3: AI Refinement

✅ Tune AI responses for basic tone detection.
✅ Improve NPC personality logic.
✅ Implement win/loss mechanics based on trust level.
Phase 4: Testing & Iteration

✅ Test AI-generated interactions.
✅ Fix bugs & improve NPC logic.
✅ Optimize player feedback system (e.g., show progress indicators).
Phase 5: MVP Deployment

✅ Deploy MVP to a test server.
✅ Collect user feedback.
✅ Plan for expanding scenarios & personalities.
What’s Next After MVP?

Once the MVP is functional, we can expand by adding:

    More conflict scenarios (personal, business, government, war, etc.).
    Multiple AI personalities (Manipulator, Skeptic, Stubborn, etc.).
    Advanced AI interactions (memory tracking, emotional analysis).
    UI/UX Enhancements (animations, speech synthesis, voice input).
    Scoring system (grading negotiation skills).
