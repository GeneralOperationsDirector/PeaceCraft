Let's proceed with the next steps:
1. Finalize Initial Conflict Scenarios

We need to define the first simple conflict scenario to test AI responses:

    Scenario Example: A person cuts in line at a store. How does the player handle it?
    Define:
        NPC personality type (e.g., Aggressor)
        Possible player approaches (calm reasoning, confrontation, passive acceptance)
        AI response framework (how NPC reacts based on trust level)

Action: I will draft a few sample scenarios and AI response prompts.
2. Develop AI Prompts for Generating Conflicts

Since Peacecraft relies on AI-generated scenarios, we need to create structured prompts to guide Ollama in generating realistic, playable conflicts.

Example AI Prompt: "Generate a conflict scenario where a player encounters an aggressive individual who cuts in line. The NPC should start hostile, and their responses should adapt based on the player's tone and word choice. The NPC should be able to escalate or de-escalate based on trust level."

Action: I will refine AI prompts and structure them for consistent NPC behavior.
3. Start Backend Development (FastAPI & AI Integration)

    Set up API endpoints for:
        Receiving player input.
        Generating AI-driven NPC responses.
        Tracking trust level and progression.
    Connect Ollama AI for real-time responses.

Action: I will outline the API architecture for FastAPI.
4. Design the UI Wireframe

The React frontend will need:

    A chat-style interface (similar to AI chatbots).
    A trust bar to show NPC reactions.
    A minimalist and clean UI.

Action: I will create a wireframe mockup for the UI.

Would you like me to start by drafting the initial conflict scenarios and AI prompt structure, or should we begin with the API architecture for FastAPI? ðŸš€
