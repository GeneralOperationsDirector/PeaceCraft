Game Concept

Peacecraft is a web-based interactive RPG designed to teach players how to diffuse hostile situations and resolve conflicts peacefully. The game follows a progression system similar to Mortal Kombat, where players must successfully resolve conflicts without failure to advance. It is a player vs. AI game, with AI-powered NPCs responding dynamically using generative AI from Ollama.

Game Structure & Rules

1. Gameplay Overview

The player engages in one-on-one conflict scenarios with AI-driven NPCs.

The goal is to de-escalate and resolve the conflict peacefully.

Players win by finding a mutually acceptable resolution.

Players lose if they fail to de-escalate or if the conflict worsens.

No predefined responses—players type their own responses, and AI interprets them dynamically.

2. Conflict Progression System

Players must successfully resolve each conflict to progress.

If a player fails, they must restart from the beginning or a checkpoint.

The game progresses from simple personal conflicts to high-stakes negotiations:

Level 1: Personal Conflicts (e.g., someone cuts in line, someone bumps into you).

Level 2: Workplace & Business Disputes (e.g., unfair treatment at work, customer complaints).

Level 3: Community & Government Conflicts (e.g., protests, political negotiations).

Level 4: War & Peace Negotiations (e.g., peace treaties, international diplomacy).

3. AI Opponent System

NPCs have different personalities and conflict styles, such as:

The Aggressor (Quick to anger)

The Manipulator (Tries to twist words)

The Emotional (Responds more to tone than logic)

The Skeptic (Doesn’t trust easily)

The Stubborn (Resistant to compromise)

AI tracks trust levels, tone, and logic to determine outcomes.

4. Game Mechanics

Real-Time AI Dialogue: Players type responses, and NPCs reply in real time.
